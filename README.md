Analysis of House Data for an Estate Agency

The project involves analyzing a dataset of house listings for an estate agency to gain insights into factors affecting house
prices, such as location, ratings, square footage, house prices, and the number of bedrooms.
Using the R programming language, exploratory data analysis and statistical modelling techniques will be applied to the
data to create visualizations, identify trends, and make predictions about the overall house condition.
